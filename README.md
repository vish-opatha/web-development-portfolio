1. This webpage has sample of work done by me organised into different sections and includes my name, cover image(I have not used a real profile image) and different sections including projects and contact details.
2. Semantic HTML is used all through out the page. Headers are used based on the importance of the sections/parts of the page. The Main section includes introduction and projects and footer includes contact details.
3. Navigation in the header section will help navigating to each section in the page. Apart from that it helps navigating to my sample resume, which will be opened in a new window.
4. Main project in the work section has larger width and height compared four other sub projects(This is achieved using width and height).
5. In work work section there are five images of projects and when a particular image is clicked it will navigate to the live URL(deployed application).
